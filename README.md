## 👨🏻‍💻 Hi everyone, I made some changes here

To make this project more organized, I moved the applications **(rest api, web client, mobile client)** to 3 different repositories.

Here are the links to them

- [REST API](https://github.com/Qwwerty/Gobarber-backend)
- [Web client](https://github.com/Qwwerty/Gobarber-backend)
- [Mobile client](https://github.com/Qwwerty/Gobarber-backend)
